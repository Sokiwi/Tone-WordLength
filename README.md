# Tone-WordLength
Scripts for preparing data and replicating analyses and replicating analyses for the paper "Tones and word length across languages".

The script Tones.R contains code for main analyses and figures. Instructions for accessing data to be combined for the purposes of the analyses are in the first part of the script. It produces pho2.RData and pho3.RData, which are also supplied for convenience. To produce these, languages.tsv and tones.tsv (from EURPhon) are needed.
